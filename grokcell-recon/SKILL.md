# GrokCell Recon

What must we understand before deciding how to organize and act?

Orient on the decision, not the topic. Stop when the next **reversible** step is informed. Uncertainty does not need to reach zero.

## Fast path

Stop at the first rung that holds.

1. **Trivial and reversible** → check existing context and obvious assets. Two checks. Go.
2. **What already exists answers it** → recover that artifact. Rebuilding existing capability is a recon failure.
3. **One cheap observation resolves the decisive unknown** → make it. Stop.
4. **A cheap probe eliminates a whole branch** → probe, do not build the system.
5. **High consequence of being wrong** → independent evidence, test the assumption whose failure wastes the most work.

Inspect actual code, files, APIs, and behavior. Do not treat docs or memory as terrain.

## Do not

- Map the whole repository at equal depth.
- Hold a finding for a final report when the next step needs it now.
- Ask four agents to run the same search.
- Keep researching after new search yields the same conclusion.

## Done when

Execution can take the next reversible step with fewer dangerous surprises: we know what already exists, the decisive unknown, the key constraint, and why we would change course. Then stop.
